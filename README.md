# Saturation Mapping
ML models to determine from local well data and deep measurements (3D measurments) the saturation pattern in the inter-well area.
ML models runned on 6 synthetic cases with water saturation, porosity and electrical resistivity data.

### Pipeline:
 Data -> Preprocessing: Standart Scaler (StandardScaler standardizes a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit variance. Unit variance means dividing all the values by the standard deviation) -> Model

### Pytorh3D
|Model                               | MSE    |
|------------------------------------|--------|
|Model-1                             | NA     |
|Model-2                             | NA     |



### Conslusion:

Even the simple regression models shows good results. However, it is possible to improve model (assumption!) using to improve model using 3D input.
Current models were implemented  using 1D inputs.
