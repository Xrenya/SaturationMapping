# Saturation Mapping
ML models to determine from local well data and deep measurements (3D measurments) the saturation pattern in the inter-well area.
ML models runned on 6 synthetic cases with water saturation, porosity and electrical resistivity data. 

## Problem
 - Understanding reservoir fluid flow is a major challenge for oil and gas companies to optimize sweep efficiency and improve recovery.  
 - Understanding of the saturation pattern is crucial to optimizing water injection, as well as the drilling of new wells. 
 - The challenge is to determine from local well data and deep measurements the saturation pattern in the interwell area. 
 
## Solution
Solution is implemented in Python.  
Input: Resistivity, Porosity.  
Output: Water saturation map â€“ export into text format.

 *<sub>(StandardScaler standardizes a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit variance. Unit variance means dividing all the values by the standard deviation)</sub>

### Conslusion:

Even the simple regression models shows good results.
