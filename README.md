# Saturation Mapping
ML models to determine from local well data and deep measurements (3D measurments) the saturation pattern in the inter-well area.
ML models runned on syntetic 


## Current results
### Baseline:
|Model                   | MSE   |
|------------------------|-------|
|KNeighborsRegressor     |0.0585 |
|RandomForestRegressor   |0.0159 |
|CatBoost                |       |
|XGBoost                 |       |

### Conslusion:

Even the simple regression models shows good results. However, it is possible to improve model (assumption!) using to improve model using 3D input.
Current models were implemented  using 1D inputs.
